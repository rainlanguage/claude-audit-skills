# Audit Pass 4: Code Quality

## General Rules

Each pass will need multiple agents to cover the full codebase. When partitioning files across agents, assign one file per agent. This ensures each agent reads its file thoroughly rather than skimming across many files.

Agents are assigned sequential IDs (A01, A02, ...) based on alphabetical order of their source file paths. Each agent prefixes its findings with its ID (e.g., A03-1, A03-2). This produces a stable global ordering: sort by agent ID, then by finding number within each agent. The ordering is deterministic because it derives from the file list, which is fixed for a given codebase snapshot.

Every pass requires reading every assigned file in full. Do not rely on grepping as a substitute for reading — systematic line-by-line review catches issues that keyword searches miss. Grepping is appropriate for cross-referencing but not for understanding code.

After reading each file, the agent must list evidence of thorough reading before reporting findings. For each file, list:
- The module/class/contract name
- Every function/method name and its line number
- Every type, error, and constant defined (if any)

This evidence must appear in the agent's output before any findings for that file. If the evidence is missing or incomplete, the audit of that file is invalid and must be re-run.

Findings from all passes should be reported, not fixed. Fixes are a separate step after findings are reviewed. A finding must identify an actual problem — something that is wrong, missing, or could go wrong. Correct behavior is not a finding at any severity. Do not report "X works correctly" or "no issues found" as findings.

Each finding must be classified as one of: **CRITICAL** (exploitable now with direct impact), **HIGH** (significant risk requiring specific conditions), **MEDIUM** (real concern with mitigating factors), **LOW** (minor issue or theoretical risk), **INFO** (suggestion for improvement with no direct risk).

Each agent must write its findings to `audit/<YYYY-MM-DD>-<NN>/pass4/<FileName>.md` where `<NN>` is a zero-padded incrementing integer starting at 01, and `<FileName>` matches the source file name (without extension). To determine `<NN>`, glob for `audit/<YYYY-MM-DD>-*` and use one higher than the highest existing number, or 01 if none exist. All passes of the same audit share the same `<NN>`. Each audit run uses this namespace so previous runs are preserved as history. Findings that only exist in agent task output are lost when context compacts — the file is the record of truth.

## Pass 4 Instructions

Review for maintainability, consistency, and good abstractions, including but not limited to:

- Audit for style consistency across the repo — when similar code uses different patterns for the same thing, flag it
- Identify leaky abstractions: internal details exposed through public interfaces, implementation concerns bleeding across module boundaries, or tight coupling between components that should be independent
- Review all commented-out code — each instance should be either reinstated or deleted, not left commented
- Ensure no warnings from the project's build toolchain
- Check that all dependency versions are consistent (no conflicting versions of the same dependency)
